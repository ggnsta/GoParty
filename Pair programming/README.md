# 1 pair: Chadovich V. and Lapotko E.
## Style: Driver Navigator
## Developed:
data access level
## What we liked:
clear division of duties allowed us to solve the problem faster and more efficiently.
## What did not like:
driver training architectural solution navigator.
## Conclusion:
This method is effective when the developer-navigator is better versed in the architecture of the application and can share this experience with the developer who has been working with the project not so long ago.

# 2 pair: Chadovich V. and Zakharchenia V.
## Style: Master-Slave
## Developed:
sorting events by location
## What we liked:
less experienced developer got deeper knowledge in the development of this task.
## What did not like:
the performance of one task requires the strength of two developers.
## Conclusion:
This method is effective when training a developer who does not have enough experience or knowledge to solve the problem independently.


# 3 pairs: Protasenya V. and Pankov V.
## Style: Ping Pong
## Developed:
application testing
## What we liked:
as a result of this work, code is obtained that is resistant to pseudo-enhancements. The probability of making mistakes when writing code is reduced due to already written tests.
## What did not like:
testing is not as interesting as the development, the error in the spelling of the test leads to disastrous consequences for both developers.
## Conclusions:
This method is effective when working in a pair of developer-testers and when there are serious requirements for testing, and this task is solved by the efforts of at least one developer
